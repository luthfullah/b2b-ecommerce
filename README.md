# B2B Ecommerce Application in MERN Stack and TypeScript

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for a comprehensive B2B and B2C E-commerce application. The project is divided into three main applications:

1. **Client Application (ReactJS and other technologies)**
2. **Server Application (API) - NodeJS, Express, JWT, Postgresql, Sequelize ORM, etc.**
3. **Admin Dashboard (TypeScript, Tailwind, and other related technologies for graphs and charts.)**
